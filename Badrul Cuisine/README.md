A `HTML, CSS` Project. Made with ♥ by ` Badrul `. There will be 5 pages in the website (HomePage, MenuPage, AboutPage, ContactPage, BookingPage). In this project we gonna learn how we can create a website using simple `HTML, CSS`. The main purpose of the project is to get more used to with HTML, CSS. Although we used a few lines of JavaScript in the project for necessary cases. Later on, in this project, we gonna learn how we can deploy this site using `Netlify`. Also, we gonna learn the process from the zero to end and make the website ready for live production.
